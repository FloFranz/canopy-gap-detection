*Canopy gap detection in three enlarged subareas (white rectangles).*

This repository contains code for forest canopy gap detection using a deep learning model trained on gaps automatically generated from airborne laser scanning (ALS)-derived canopy height models (CHMs), combined with spectral (true digital orthophotos) and height information from digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP)-based CHMs. For further details, see the following paper:
